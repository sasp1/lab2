This file is just to remember the passwords that were encrypted in the password.txt file and should
obviously not be included. So, to login you can use one of these 4 passwords down there. The rows line up,
so the first row in password.txt is the salt and encrypted password (separated by ':')

secret_password
0000
123456
qwerty
